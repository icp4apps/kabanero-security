= Configuring Kabanero with Red Hat Single Sign On

After Kabanero is installed, the Kabanero operator can optionally create an instance of Red Hat Single Sign On (RHSSO) for development use.
To create the RHSSO instance, create the required secret and the persistent volume and then edit the Kabnero custom resource (CR).

. Create a persistent volume (PV) of size 1 GB. The type of storage used might vary depending on the environment where OpenShift is installed.
Some types of persistent volumes, such as NFS require that you set up an NFS server in your cluster first.

.. In your OCP console, in the kabanero project namespace, click **Storage -> Persistent Volumes -> Create Persistent Volume**.  
Edit the yaml as needed for your cluster's storage configuration.  Here is an example using NFS:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: sso-pv
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  nfs:
    path: /root/persistentvolumes
    server: 10.26.1.100
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  volumeMode: Filesystem
----
+
**Note:** Other components may also require a persistent volume.  Run `oc -n kabanero get pv` and check that the PV remains available. If some other component binds to it (status is **BOUND**), create another PV, or disable the other component if it is not being used. 
+
. Create a secret. 
.. In your OCP console, in the kabanero project namespace, click **Workloads -> Secrets -> Create** and create a **key/value secret**.
.. `Secret Name` can be: `rhsso-secret` (Make a note of the name that you use for updating the Kabanero CR later.)
.. Add three key-value pairs to the secret. (Select add Key/Value to add the other pairs after the first pair.)
... Key: `SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME` Value:  The administrator username for RHSSO, for example `myadminid`.
... Key: `SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` Value:  The administrator password for RHSSO, for example `myadminpassword`.
... Key: `SSO_REALM` Value: The security realm name for RHSSO to use, for example `testing_realm`.
. Click **Create**

. Edit the Kabanero CR, under sso:
.. set enable to `true`
.. set adminSecretName to `rhsso-secret`
.. click **Save**

. The URL to the RHSSO console can be found in the OCP console, in the kabanero project namespace, under networking, in the **sso** route.  Use the values that were supplied in the secret for `SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to login in to the RHSSO console.
