# Kabanero Application  Single-signon

## Key Concepts / Background
- As part of the security story for Kabanero, we need a way for application runtimes to be able to offer a single-signon option (based on Open ID Connect) out of the box.

[High level overview](../design/kabanero_app_sso.pdf)

## User stories
- As Champ (solution architect), I would like to be able to ensure that there is a single signon (OIDC Provider/Server) available for apoplication runtimes to use as part of the Kabanero install/operator in order to offer an immediate SSO experience.

## As-is

- There is no default application SSO environment in the OpenShift/Kabanero environment.

## To-be
- When a Kabanero instance is installed, regardless of the runtime stack in use, there is a running single sign-on server, based on Open ID Connect.

## Main Feature design

- The following are the steps we will automate, installing and operating a RH-SSO/Keycloak instance in the Kabanero environment:
#### 1) xxxxxxx

#### 2) xxxxxxx

#### 3) xxxxxxx
